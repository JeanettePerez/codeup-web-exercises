			go, go, go, go, go! Life finds a way. You know what? It is beets.
			I've crashed into a beet truck. Did he just throw my cat out of

			King Kong?We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste,
			pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this
			planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Do you have any idea how long
			it takes those cups to decompose. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always
			trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

			my espresso machine? Just my luck, no ice. God creates dinosaurs.
			God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God.
			Man creates Dinosaurs. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go!
			They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is
			ticking.I was part of something special. So you two dig up,
			dig up dinosaurs? You really think you can fly that thing?
			Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Jaguar shark!

			long it takes those cups to decompose.</p>
